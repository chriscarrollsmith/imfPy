    "text": "imfp, created and maintained by Promptly Technologies, is a Python package for downloading data from the International Monetary Fund’s RESTful JSON API.\n\n\nTo install the stable version of imfp from PyPi, use pip.\npip install --upgrade imfp\nTo load the library, use import:\n\nimport imfp\n\n\n\n\nThe imfp package introduces four core functions: imf_databases, imf_parameters, imf_parameter_defs, and imf_dataset. The function for downloading datasets is imf_dataset, but you will need the other functions to determine what arguments to supply to your imf_dataset function call.\n\n\nFor instance, all calls to imf_dataset require a database_id. This is because the IMF serves many different databases through its API, and the API needs to know which of these many databases you’re requesting data from.\nTo fetch a list of available databases, use:\n\n# Fetch list of available databases\ndatabases = imfp.imf_databases()\n\nSee Working with Databases for more information.\n\n\n\nRequests to fetch data from IMF databases are complicated by the fact that each database uses a different set of parameters when making a request. (At last count, there were 43 unique parameters used in making API requests from the various databases!) You also have to have the list of valid input codes for each parameter. See Working with Parameters for a more detailed explanation of parameters and input codes and how they work.\nTo obtain the full list of parameters and valid input codes for a given database, use:\n\n# Fetch list of valid parameters and input codes for commodity price database\nparams = imfp.imf_parameters(\"PCPS\")\n\nThe imf_parameters function returns a dictionary of data frames. Each dictionary key name corresponds to a parameter used in making requests from the database:\n\n# Get key names from the params object\nparams.keys()\n\ndict_keys(['freq', 'ref_area', 'commodity', 'unit_measure'])\n\n\nEach named list item is a data frame containing the valid input codes (and their descriptions) that can be used with the named parameter.\nTo access the data frame containing valid values for each parameter, subset the params dict by the parameter name:\n\n# View the data frame of valid input codes for the frequency parameter\nparams['freq']\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput_code\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n0\nA\nAnnual\n\n\n1\nM\nMonthly\n\n\n2\nQ\nQuarterly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make a request to fetch data from the IMF API, just call imfp.imf_dataset with the database ID and keyword arguments for each parameter, where the keyword argument name is the parameter name and the value is the list of codes you want.\nFor instance, on exploring the freq parameter of the Primary Commodity Price System database above, we found that the frequency can take one of three values: “A” for annual, “Q” for quarterly, and “M” for monthly. Thus, to request annual data, we can call imfp.imf_dataset with freq = [\"A\"].\nSimilarly, we might search the dataframes of valid input codes for the commodity and unit_measure parameters to find the input codes for coal and index:\n\n# Find the 'commodity' input code for coal\nparams['commodity'].loc[\n    params['commodity']['description'].str.contains(\"Coal\")\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput_code\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n14\nPCOAL\nPrimary Commodity Prices, Coal index\n\n\n15\nPCOALAU\nPrimary Commodity Prices, Coal, Australia\n\n\n16\nPCOALSA\nPrimary Commodity Prices, Coal, South Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Find the 'unit_measure' input code for index\nparams['unit_measure'].loc[\n    params['unit_measure']['description'].str.contains(\"Index\")\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput_code\ndescription\n\n\n\n\n0\nIX\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can use the information we’ve gathered to make the request to fetch the data:\n\n# Request data from the API\ndf = imfp.imf_dataset(database_id = \"PCPS\",\n         freq = [\"A\"], commodity = [\"PCOAL\", \"PCOALAU\", \"PCOALSA\"],\n         unit_measure = [\"IX\"],\n         start_year = 2000, end_year = 2015)\n\n# Display the first few entries in the retrieved data frame\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfreq\nref_area\ncommodity\nunit_measure\nunit_mult\ntime_format\ntime_period\nobs_value\n\n\n\n\n0\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2000\n39.3510230293202\n\n\n1\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2001\n49.3378587284039\n\n\n2\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2002\n39.4949091648006\n\n\n3\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2003\n43.2878876950788\n\n\n4\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2004\n82.9185858052862\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe returned data frame has a time_format column that contains ISO 8601 duration codes. In this case, “P1Y” means “periods of 1 year.” The unit_mult column represents the power of 10 to which the value column should be raised. For instance, if value is in millions, then the unit multiplier will be 6 (meaning 10^6). If in billions, then the unit multiplier will be 9 (meaning 10^9). For more information on interpreting the returned data frame, see Understanding the Data Frame.\n\n\n\n\nNote that all columns in the returned data frame are string objects, and to plot the series we will need to convert to valid numeric or date formats:\n\n# Convert obs_value to numeric and time_period to integer year\ndf = df.astype({\"time_period\" : int, \"obs_value\" : float})\n\nThen, using seaborn with hue, we can plot different indicators in different colors:\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Plot prices of different commodities in different colors with seaborn\nsns.lineplot(data=df, x='time_period', y='obs_value', hue='commodity');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe welcome contributions to improve imfp!

    "text": "The IMF API imposes very restrictive (and incompletely documented) rate limits, not only for individual users and applications, but also globally for all users of the API. Thus, at high-traffic times, you may find that your requests fail. It’s highly recommended that you set up proactive error handling, wait times, retries, and request caching to avoid hitting the API’s rate limits. The imfp library provides some tools to help you do this (with more planned for future releases).\n\n\nThe IMF API has an application-based rate limit of 50 requests per second. Each application is identified by the “user_agent” variable in the request header. By default, all imfp users share the same application name, which could lead to rate limit issues if many users are making requests simultaneously.\nThis could prove problematic if the imfp library became too popular and too many users tried to make simultaneous API requests using the default app name. By setting a custom application name, users can avoid hitting this rate limit and being blocked by the API. To solve this problem, imfp supplies the set_imf_app_name() function to set a custom application name.\nset_imf_app_name() sets the application name by changing the IMF_APP_NAME variable in the environment. If this variable doesn’t exist, set_imf_app_name() will create it. To set a custom application name, simply call the set_imf_app_name() function with your desired application name as an argument:\n\nimport imfp\n\n# Set custom app name as an environment variable\nimfp.set_imf_app_name(\"my_custom_app_name\")\n\nThe function will throw an error if the provided name is missing, NULL, NA, not a string, or longer than 255 characters. If the provided name is “imfp” (the default) or an empty string, the function will issue a warning recommending the use of a unique app name to avoid hitting rate limits.\n\n\n\nIf making multiple requests in a short period of time, you may want to increase the wait time between requests to avoid hitting the API’s rate limits. This is done with the set_imf_wait_time() function:\n\n# Increase wait time to 5 seconds\nimfp.set_imf_wait_time(5)\n\n\n\n\nimfp automatically handles rate limits with exponential backoff:\n\nWaits for specified time\nRetries the request\nIncreases wait time exponentially on subsequent failures\nStops after 3 attempts (default)\n\nYou can modify retry behavior:\n\n# Retry 4 times rather than the default 3\ndf = imfp.imf_dataset(\"IFS\", \"NGDP_D_SA_IX\", times=4)\n\n\n\n\nTo reduce API calls, you can cache frequently accessed data. For instance, in a Jupyter or Quarto notebook that you run multiple times, you can wrap each imfp function call in an if statement that checks if the returned data has already been saved to a file. If it has, it loads the data from the file. If it hasn’t, it fetches the data from the API and saves it to a file.\nNote that to run this code, you will need to install the pyarrow library, which pandas uses as its engine for reading and writing parquet files (but which is not installed with pandas or imfp by default). Use pip install pyarrow to install it.\n\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Fetch imf databases from file if available, else from API\ncache_path = f\"data/imf_databases.parquet\"\nif os.path.exists(cache_path):\n    databases = pd.read_parquet(cache_path)\nelse:\n    databases = imfp.imf_databases()\n    os.makedirs(\"data\", exist_ok=True)\n    databases.to_parquet(cache_path)\n\nYou can also functionalize this logic to permit reuse several times in the same script or notebook.

However, these columns use input codes (short identifiers) rather than human-readable descriptions. To make your data more interpretable, you can replace these codes with their corresponding text descriptions using the parameter information from imf_parameters, so that codes like “A” (Annual) or “W00” (World) become self-explanatory labels.\nFor example, suppose we want to decode the freq (frequency), ref_area (geographical area), and unit_measure (unit) columns in our dataset. We’ll merge the parameter descriptions into our data frame:\n\n# Decode frequency codes (e.g., \"A\" → \"Annual\")\ndf = df.merge(\n    # Select code-description pairs\n    params['freq'][['input_code', 'description']],\n    # Match codes in the data frame\n    left_on='freq',\n    # ...to codes in the parameter data\n    right_on='input_code',\n    # Keep all data rows\n    how='left'\n).drop(columns=['freq', 'input_code']\n).rename(columns={\"description\": \"freq\"})\n\n# Decode geographic area codes (e.g., \"W00\" → \"World\")\ndf = df.merge(\n    params['ref_area'][['input_code', 'description']],\n    left_on='ref_area',\n    right_on='input_code',\n    how='left'\n).drop(columns=['ref_area', 'input_code']\n).rename(columns={\"description\":\"ref_area\"})\n\n# Decode unit codes (e.g., \"IX\" → \"Index\")\ndf = df.merge(\n    params['unit_measure'][['input_code', 'description']],\n    left_on='unit_measure',\n    right_on='input_code',\n    how='left'\n).drop(columns=['unit_measure', 'input_code']\n).rename(columns={\"description\":\"unit_measure\"})\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommodity\nunit_mult\ntime_format\ntime_period\nobs_value\nfreq\nref_area\nunit_measure\n\n\n\n\n0\nPCOAL\n0\nP1Y\n2000\n39.3510230293202\nAnnual\nAll Countries, excluding the IO\nIndex\n\n\n1\nPCOAL\n0\nP1Y\n2001\n49.3378587284039\nAnnual\nAll Countries, excluding the IO\nIndex\n\n\n2\nPCOAL\n0\nP1Y\n2002\n39.4949091648006\nAnnual\nAll Countries, excluding the IO\nIndex\n\n\n3\nPCOAL\n0\nP1Y\n2003\n43.2878876950788\nAnnual\nAll Countries, excluding the IO\nIndex\n\n\n4\nPCOAL\n0\nP1Y\n2004\n82.9185858052862\nAnnual\nAll Countries, excluding the IO\nIndex\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter decoding, the data frame is much more human-interpretable.

It is a great tool comparing a country’s economic development compared to other economies. Due to dataset access issue, we calculated Real GDP per capita by the following formula using GDP Deflator, Nominal GDP, and Population data:\n\\(\\text{Real GDP} = \\frac{\\text{Nominal GDP}}{\\text{GDP Deflator Index}}\\times 100\\)\n\\(\\text{Real GDP per capita} = \\frac{\\text{Real GDP}}{\\text{Population}}\\)\nGDP Deflator is a measure of price inflation and deflation with respect to a specific base year. The GDP deflator of a base year is equal to 100. A number of 200 indicates price inflation: the current year price of the good is twice its base year price. A number of 50 indicates price deflation: the current year price of the good is half its base year price. We kept the columns we want only for GDP-related datasets for easier table merging.\n\n# GDP Deflator Dataset\n# Create a new dataframe with only the required columns\nGDP_deflator_data = GDP_deflator_data[\n    ['ref_area', 'time_period', 'unit_mult', 'obs_value']].copy()\n\n# Display the first few rows of the new dataset\nGDP_deflator_data.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nref_area\ntime_period\nunit_mult\nobs_value\n\n\n\n\n3\nFI\n1990\n0\n73.200623\n\n\n7\nFI\n1991\n0\n73.984068\n\n\n11\nFI\n1992\n0\n74.654309\n\n\n15\nFI\n1993\n0\n75.619254\n\n\n19\nFI\n1994\n0\n77.937293\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNominal GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a given time period.

To provide a more informative view, we sequenced countries in an ascending order by the median of percent change in GDP.\nThe boxplot displayed a slight upward trend with no obvious pattern between GDP and GII change. In coutries with higher GDP change median, they also tend to have a larger spread of the GDP change. The median of GII change remained stable regardless of the magnitude of GDP change, implying weak or no association between GDP and GII change.

A negative correlation coefficient indicates a negative relationship: the larger the GDP change, the smaller the GII change. A correlation coefficient closer to 0 indicates there is weak or no relationship.\nBased on the numeric values in the plot, there was a moderately strong positive correlation between GII and GDP change for country Estonia(EE) and Ireland(IE).\n\n# Calculate the correlation\ncountry_correlation = combined_data.groupby('Country')[\n    ['GII_change', 'GDP_change']].corr().iloc[0::2, -1].reset_index(name='Correlation')\n\n# Put the correlation value in a matrix format\ncorrelation_matrix = country_correlation.pivot(index='Country', \ncolumns='level_1', \nvalues='Correlation')\n\n# Check for NaN values in the correlation matrix\n# Replace NaNs with 0 or another value as appropriate\ncorrelation_matrix.fillna(0, inplace=True)  \n\n# Set up the plot structure\n# Adjust height to give more space for y-axis labels\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 12))  \n\n# Plot the heatmap\nsns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', center=0, \ncbar_kws={\"shrink\": .8}, \nlinewidths=.5)\n\n# Enhance axis labels and title\nplt.title('Heatmap for GII and GDP Change', fontsize=20)\nplt.xlabel('Variables', fontsize=16)\nplt.ylabel('Country', fontsize=16)\n\n# Improve readability of y-axis labels\nplt.yticks(fontsize=12)  # Adjust the font size for y-axis labels\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()"

Only 0.4% of the variance in GII change could be explained by GDP change.\nWe were 95% confident that the interval from -0.003 to 0.169 captured the true slope of GDP change. Because 0 was included, we are uncertain about the effect of GDP change on GII chnage.\n\n\n# Get column data type summaries of combined_data\ncombined_data.info()\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nIndex: 896 entries, 1 to 973\nData columns (total 10 columns):\n #   Column               Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------               --------------  -----  \n 0   Country              896 non-null    object \n 1   Time                 896 non-null    object \n 2   GII                  896 non-null    float64\n 3   GII_change           896 non-null    float64\n 4   Nominal              896 non-null    float64\n 5   Deflator             896 non-null    float64\n 6   Population           896 non-null    float64\n 7   Real GDP             896 non-null    float64\n 8   Real GDP per Capita  896 non-null    float64\n 9   GDP_change           896 non-null    float64\ndtypes: float64(8), object(2)\nmemory usage: 77.0+ KB\n\n\n\n# Define independent and depenent variables\nX = combined_data['GDP_change']\ny = combined_data['GII_change']\n\n# Add a constant to indepdent variable to include an intercept\nX = sm.add_constant(X)\n\n# Fit a simple linear regresion model and print out the summary\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()\nmodel.summary()\n\n\nOLS Regression Results\n\n\nDep.

We proceeded to the time series modeling section.\n\n# Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for stationarity check\n# Create melted datasets\ncombined_data_time = combined_data.melt(id_vars=['Time', 'Country'], \nvalue_vars=['GII_change','GDP_change'], \nvar_name = 'Change_Type', \nvalue_name = 'Value')\nGII = combined_data_time[(combined_data_time['Change_Type'] == 'GII_change')]                         \n\nGDP = combined_data_time[(combined_data_time['Change_Type'] == 'GDP_change')]\n\n# Stationary Check\ndef adf_test(series):\n    result = adfuller(series.dropna())\n    print(f'ADF Statistic: {result[0]}')\n    print(f'p-value: {result[1]}')\n    if result[1] &lt; 0.05:\n        print(\"Series is stationary\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Series is not stationary\")\n\n# Output the result\nadf_test(GII['Value'])\nadf_test(GDP['Value'])\n\nADF Statistic: -13.258508444109324\np-value: 8.491362672400665e-25\nSeries is stationary\nADF Statistic: -13.53669426905047\np-value: 2.559492685554561e-25\nSeries is stationary\n\n\n\n\nVAR model: Examine variables separately\nWe fitted a VAR (Vector Autoreression) model to see the relationship between GII and GDP change. VAR is particularly useful when dealing with multivariate time series data and allows us to examine the interdependence between variables.\nBased on summary, here were several interpretations we could make:\n\nWe used AIC as the criteria for model selection. Lower value suggests a better fit.\nGiven that we wanted to predict GII change, we focused on the first set “Results for equation GII_change.”\nPast GII_change values significantly influenced current GII_change, as shown in the small p-values of lags 1 and 2.\nLag 2 of GDP_change had a relatively low p-value but is not statistically significant.\n\n\n# Split the dataset into training and testing sets\nsplit_ratio = 0.7\nsplit_index = int(len(combined_data) * split_ratio)\n\n# Training set is used to fit the model\ntrain_data = combined_data.iloc[:split_index]\n\n# Testing set is used for validation\ntest_data = combined_data.iloc[split_index:]\n\nprint(f\"Training data: {train_data.shape}\")\nprint(f\"Test data: {test_data.shape}\")\n\nTraining data: (627, 10)\nTest data: (269, 10)\n\n\n\n# Fit a VAR model \ntime_model = VAR(train_data[['GII_change', 'GDP_change']])\ntime_model_fitted = time_model.fit(maxlags = 15, ic=\"aic\")\n\n# Print out the model summary\ntime_model_fitted.summary()\n\n  Summary of Regression Results   \n==================================\nModel:                         VAR\nMethod:                        OLS\nDate:           Sat, 08, Feb, 2025\nTime:                     01:19:41\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNo. of Equations:         2.00000    BIC:                   -12.6388\nNobs:                     624.000    HQIC:                  -12.6996\nLog likelihood:           2217.52    FPE:                2.93645e-06\nAIC:                     -12.7383    Det(Omega_mle):     2.87166e-06\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nResults for equation GII_change\n================================================================================\n                   coefficient       std. error           t-stat            prob\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nconst                -0.014401         0.002527           -5.698           0.000\nL1.GII_change         0.206183         0.040171            5.133           0.000\nL1.GDP_change         0.008941         0.037668            0.237           0.812\nL2.GII_change         0.147039         0.040539            3.627           0.000\nL2.GDP_change        -0.038093         0.037741           -1.009           0.313\nL3.GII_change         0.071829         0.040373            1.779           0.075\nL3.GDP_change         0.041997         0.037485            1.120           0.263\n================================================================================\n\nResults for equation GDP_change\n================================================================================\n                   coefficient       std. error           t-stat            prob\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nconst                 0.017922         0.002668            6.719           0.000\nL1.GII_change        -0.021878         0.042400           -0.516           0.606\nL1.GDP_change         0.132221         0.039758            3.326           0.001\nL2.GII_change         0.124973         0.042789            2.921           0.003\nL2.GDP_change         0.025632         0.039835            0.643           0.520\nL3.GII_change        -0.063330         0.042614           -1.486           0.137\nL3.GDP_change         0.146934         0.039565            3.714           0.000\n================================================================================\n\nCorrelation matrix of residuals\n              GII_change  GDP_change\nGII_change      1.000000   -0.033903\nGDP_change     -0.033903    1.000000\n\n\n\n\n\nVAR Model: Forecasting\nWe applied the model learned above to the test data.

    "text": "Future Directions\nFirst, we must consider what other factors might influence the relationship between GDP and GII change. The GII is a composite index, shaped by a myriad of social factors, including cultural norms, legal frameworks, and environmental shifts. Future studies could benefit from incorporating additional predictors into the analysis and exploring the interaction between economic growth and gender equality within specific country contexts.\nSecond, there’s potential to enhance the predictive power of our Vector Autoregression (VAR) time series model. While we established that GDP change does not cause GII change, our model performed well in forecasting trends for both variables independently. In practice, policymakers may want to forecast GII trends independently of GDP if they are implementing gender-focused policies. Future research could investigate time series modeling to further unravel the dynamics of GII and GDP changes.\nSo, as we wrap up this chapter, let’s keep our curiosity alive and our questions flowing. After all, every end is just a new beginning in the quest for knowledge!"

We refer to these values as “input codes,” because you can input them in your API request to filter the data.\nWhat this means, though, is that before making an API request to retrieve data, you need to know what the available filtering parameters are for the database, and what codes you can use for filtering the data by each parameter.\nThere are two main functions for working with parameters:\n\nimf_parameters(): Get the full list of parameters and valid input codes for a database\nimf_parameter_defs(): Get text descriptions of what each parameter represents"

    "text": "Supplying Parameters\n\nBasic Approach (Recommended for Most Users)\nTo make a request to fetch data from the IMF API, just call imf_dataset with the database ID and keyword arguments for each parameter, where the keyword argument name is the parameter name and the value is the list of codes you want.\nFor instance, on exploring the freq parameter of the Primary Commodity Price System database above, we found that the frequency can take one of three values: “A” for annual, “Q” for quarterly, and “M” for monthly. Thus, to request annual data, we can call imf_dataset with freq = [\"A\"].\nHere’s a complete example that fetches annual coal prices for the years 2000 through 2015:\n\n# Example: Get annual coal prices\ndf = imfp.imf_dataset(\n    database_id=\"PCPS\",\n    freq=[\"A\"],  # Annual frequency\n    commodity=[\"PCOAL\"],  # Coal prices\n    start_year=2000,\n    end_year=2015\n)\n\n\n\nAdvanced Approaches\nFor more complex queries, there are two programmatic ways to supply parameters to imf_dataset. These approaches are particularly useful when you need to filter parameters based on their descriptions or when working with multiple parameter values.\n\n1. List Arguments with Parameter Filtering\nThis approach uses string matching to find the correct parameter codes before passing them to imf_dataset:\n\n# Fetch the input code column of the freq parameter...\nselected_freq = list(\n    params['freq']['input_code'][\n        # ...where the description contains \"Annual\"\n        params['freq']['description'].str.contains(\"Annual\")\n    ]\n)\n\n# Fetch the input code column of the commodity parameter...\nselected_commodity = list(\n    params['commodity']['input_code'][\n        # ...where the description contains \"Coal\"\n        params['commodity']['description'].str.contains(\"Coal\")\n    ]\n)\n\n# Fetch the input code column of the unit_measure parameter...\nselected_unit_measure = list(\n    params['unit_measure']['input_code'][\n        # ...where the description contains \"Index\"\n        params['unit_measure']['description'].str.contains(\"Index\")\n    ]\n)\n\n# Request data from the API using the filtered parameter code lists\ndf = imfp.imf_dataset(\n    database_id=\"PCPS\",\n    freq=selected_freq,\n    commodity=selected_commodity,\n    unit_measure=selected_unit_measure,\n    start_year=2000,\n    end_year=2015\n)\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfreq\nref_area\ncommodity\nunit_measure\nunit_mult\ntime_format\ntime_period\nobs_value\n\n\n\n\n0\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2000\n39.3510230293202\n\n\n1\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2001\n49.3378587284039\n\n\n2\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2002\n39.4949091648006\n\n\n3\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2003\n43.2878876950788\n\n\n4\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2004\n82.9185858052862\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Parameters Dictionary Approach\nThis approach modifies the parameters dictionary directly and passes the entire filtered dictionary to imf_dataset as a single parameters keyword argument. This is more concise but requires understanding how the parameters dictionary works:\n\n# Copy the params dictionary\nmodified_params = params.copy()\n\n# Overwrite the data frame for each parameter in the dictionary with filtered rows\nmodified_params['freq'] = params['freq'][\n    # ...where the input code description for freq contains \"Annual\"\n    params['freq']['description'].str.contains(\"Annual\")\n]\nmodified_params['commodity'] = params['commodity'][\n    # ...where the input code description for commodity contains \"Coal\"\n    params['commodity']['description'].str.contains(\"Coal\")\n]\nmodified_params['unit_measure'] = params['unit_measure'][\n    # ...where the input code description for unit_measure contains \"Index\"\n    params['unit_measure']['description'].str.contains(\"Index\")\n]\n\n# Pass the modified dictionary to imf_dataset\ndf = imfp.imf_dataset(\n    database_id=\"PCPS\",\n    parameters=modified_params,\n    start_year=2000,\n    end_year=2015\n)\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfreq\nref_area\ncommodity\nunit_measure\nunit_mult\ntime_format\ntime_period\nobs_value\n\n\n\n\n0\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2000\n39.3510230293202\n\n\n1\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2001\n49.3378587284039\n\n\n2\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2002\n39.4949091648006\n\n\n3\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2003\n43.2878876950788\n\n\n4\nA\nW00\nPCOAL\nIX\n0\nP1Y\n2004\n82.9185858052862\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that when using the parameters dictionary approach, you cannot combine it with individual parameter arguments. If you supply a parameters argument, any other keyword arguments for individual parameters will be ignored."

    "text": "Common Data Transformations\nThe International Financial Statistics (IFS) database provides key macroeconomic aggregates that are frequently needed when working with other IMF datasets. Here, we’ll demonstrate how to use three fundamental indicators—GDP, price deflators, and population statistics—to transform your data.\nThese transformations are essential for:\n\nConverting nominal to real dollar values\nCalculating per capita metrics\nHarmonizing data across different frequencies\nAdjusting for different unit scales\n\nFor a complete, end-to-end example of these transformations in a real analysis workflow, see Jenny Xu’s superb demo notebook.\n\nFetching IFS Adjusters\nFirst, let’s retrieve the key adjustment variables from the IFS database:\n\n# Fetch GDP Deflator (Index, Annual)\ndeflator = imfp.imf_dataset(\n    database_id=\"IFS\",\n    indicator=\"NGDP_D_SA_IX\",\n    freq=\"Q\",\n    start_year=2010\n)\n\n# Fetch Population Estimates (Annual)\npopulation = imfp.imf_dataset(\n    database_id=\"IFS\",\n    indicator=\"LP_PE_NUM\",\n    freq=\"A\",\n    start_year=2010\n)\n\n# Fetch Exchange Rate (Annual)\nexchange_rate = imfp.imf_dataset(\n    database_id=\"IFS\", \n    indicator=\"ENDE_XDC_USD_RATE\",\n    freq=\"Q\",\n    # start_year=2010 currently breaks this query for some reason\n)\n\nWe’ll also retireve a nominal GDP series to be adjusted:\n\n# Fetch Nominal GDP (Domestic currency, annual)\nnominal_gdp = imfp.imf_dataset(\n    database_id=\"IFS\", \n    indicator=\"NGDP_XDC\",\n    freq=\"A\",\n    start_year=2010\n)\n\nKey IFS Indicators:\n\nNGDP_D_SA_IX: GDP deflator index (seasonally adjusted)\nLP_PE_NUM: Population estimates\nENDE_XDC_USD_RATE: Exchange rate (domestic currency per USD)\nNGDP_XDC: Nominal GDP in domestic currency\n\n\n\nHarmonizing Frequencies\nWhen working with data of different frequencies, you’ll often need to harmonize them. For example, population and national GDP are available at an annual frequency, while the GDP deflator and exchange rates can only be obtained at a monthly or quarterly frequency. There are two common approaches:\n\nUsing Q4 values: This approach is often used for stock variables (measurements taken at a point in time) and when you want to align with end-of-year values:\n\n\n# Keep only Q4 observations for annual comparisons\ndeflator = deflator[deflator['time_period'].str.contains(\"Q4\")]\nexchange_rate = exchange_rate[exchange_rate['time_period'].str.contains(\"Q4\")]\n\n# Extract just the year from the time period for Q4 data\ndeflator['time_period'] = deflator['time_period'].str[:4]\nexchange_rate['time_period'] = exchange_rate['time_period'].str[:4]\n\n\nCalculating annual averages: This approach is more appropriate for flow variables (measurements over a period) and when you want to smooth out seasonal variations:\n\n\n# Alternative: Calculate annual averages\ndeflator = deflator.groupby(\n    ['ref_area', deflator['time_period']], \n    as_index=False\n).agg({\n    'obs_value': 'mean'\n})\n\nChoose the appropriate method based on your specific analysis needs and the economic meaning of your variables.\n\n\nUnit Multiplier Adjustment\nIMF data often includes a unit_mult column that indicates the scale of the values (e.g., millions, billions). We can write a helper function to apply these scaling factors:\n\ndef apply_unit_multiplier(df):\n    \"\"\"Convert to numeric, adjust values using IMF's scaling factors, and drop\n    missing values\"\"\"\n    df['obs_value'] = pd.to_numeric(df['obs_value'])\n    df['unit_mult'] = pd.to_numeric(df['unit_mult'])\n    df['adjusted_value'] = df['obs_value'] * 10 ** df['unit_mult']\n    df = df.dropna(subset=[\"obs_value\"])\n    return df\n\n# Apply to each dataset\ndeflator = apply_unit_multiplier(deflator)\npopulation = apply_unit_multiplier(population)\nexchange_rate = apply_unit_multiplier(exchange_rate)\nnominal_gdp = apply_unit_multiplier(nominal_gdp)\n\n\n\nMerging Datasets\nAfter harmonizing unit scales, we can combine the datasets using pd.DataFrame.merge() with ref_area and time_period as keys:\n\nmerged = (\n    nominal_gdp.merge(\n        deflator,\n        on=['ref_area', 'time_period'],\n        suffixes=('_gdp', '_deflator')\n    )\n    .merge(\n        population,\n        on=['ref_area', 'time_period']\n    )\n    .merge(\n        exchange_rate,\n        on=['ref_area', 'time_period'],\n        suffixes=('_population', '_exchange_rate')\n    )\n)\n\n\n\nCalculating Real Values\nWith the merged dataset, we can now calculate real GDP and per capita values:\n\n# Convert nominal to real GDP\nmerged['real_gdp'] = (\n    (merged['adjusted_value_gdp'] / merged['adjusted_value_deflator']) * 100\n)\n\n# Calculate per capita values (using population obs_value)\nmerged['real_gdp_per_capita'] = merged['real_gdp'] / merged['adjusted_value_population']\n\n# Display the first 5 rows of the transformed data\nmerged[['time_period', 'real_gdp', 'real_gdp_per_capita']].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime_period\nreal_gdp\nreal_gdp_per_capita\n\n\n\n\n0\n2011\n3551364668794.20\n82248.89\n\n\n1\n2012\n3792317490278.53\n85521.44\n\n\n2\n2013\n3967309320845.69\n87155.33\n\n\n3\n2014\n4144699824894.22\n88751.48\n\n\n4\n2015\n4417512779956.08\n92265.37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExchange Rate Adjustment\nNote that this result is still in the domestic currency of the country. If you need to convert to a common currency, you can use the exchange rate data from the IFS database.\n\n# Because 'adjusted_value_exrate' is local-currency-per-USD,\n# dividing local-currency real GDP by it yields GDP in USD.\nmerged[\"real_gdp_usd\"] = (\n    merged[\"real_gdp\"] / merged[\"adjusted_value_exchange_rate\"]\n)\n\n# (Optional) real GDP per capita in USD\nmerged[\"real_gdp_usd_per_capita\"] = (\n    merged[\"real_gdp_usd\"] / merged[\"adjusted_value_population\"]\n)\n\n# Inspect results\nmerged[[\"time_period\",\"ref_area\",\"real_gdp\",\"real_gdp_usd\",\"real_gdp_usd_per_capita\"]].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntime_period\nref_area\nreal_gdp\nreal_gdp_usd\nreal_gdp_usd_per_capita\n\n\n\n\n0\n2011\nKE\n3551364668794.20\n41747313843.78\n966.86\n\n\n1\n2012\nKE\n3792317490278.53\n44096304805.05\n994.43\n\n\n2\n2013\nKE\n3967309320845.69\n45965960945.06\n1009.80\n\n\n3\n2014\nKE\n4144699824894.22\n45796944714.40\n980.66\n\n\n4\n2015\nKE\n4417512779956.08\n43177131580.22\n901.81"
